    "\n",
    "In this example we use the UCI Bank Marketing dataset to showcase how you can use AutoML for a  classification problem and deploy it to an Azure Container Instance (ACI). The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit with the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using an Azure Machine Learning Compute Instance, you are all set.  Otherwise, go through the [configuration](../../../configuration.ipynb)  notebook first if you haven't already to establish your connection to the AzureML Workspace. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please find the ONNX related documentations [here](https://github.com/onnx/onnx).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will learn how to:\n",
    "1. Create an experiment using an existing workspace.\n",
    "2. Configure AutoML using `AutoMLConfig`.\n",
    "3. Train the model using local compute with ONNX compatible config on.\n",
    "4. Explore the results, featurization transparency options and save the ONNX model\n",
    "5. Inference with the ONNX model.\n",
    "6. Register the model.\n",
    "7. Create a container image.\n",
    "8. Create an Azure Container Instance (ACI) service.\n",
    "9. Test the ACI service.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition this notebook showcases the following features\n",
    "- **Blocking** certain pipelines\n",
    "- Specifying **target metrics** to indicate stopping criteria\n",
    "- Handling **missing data** in the input"
